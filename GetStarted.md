# Get Started #

This section is about getting started with Course Builder. The pages take you through downloading and installing the necessary software, including the sample course provided with Course Builder.  Later pages get you started running the sample code for the first time and exploring what's in it. The final page contains a small set of Google App Engine information you may find particularly useful when working with Course Builder.

> <b>Note for PC users:</b> Do **not** use Notepad to edit Course Builder files. If you do, every Course Builder file appears to be one long line. Please use another text editor, such as WordPad or Notepad++.
